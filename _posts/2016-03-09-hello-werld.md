## Hello Werld

Hello. I'm Paul. You know that from my portfolio site [here](http://www.paulbarrettdev.com), hopefully.

Anyway, I've had a few abortive attempts at blogs down the years and now that I have a new found confidence and realisation that I need to be my own best advocate, I'm going to have another go.

The world of web development has advanced "at pace" recently and it's really hard to keep up. It feels overwhelming. I'm going to try to take it all one small piece at a time and write up my efforts here.

I'll hopefully intersperse this with some music and Everton ramblings for variety.

Okay, here we go.
